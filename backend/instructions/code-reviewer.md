# Convert and Optimize Go Code with GoFr Framework

## Objective
Perform the following tasks based on the provided Go code file:
1. **Convert plain Go HTTP code into GoFr framework**.
2. **Optimize existing GoFr code** by applying best practices for improved performance, readability, and maintainability.

---

## Instructions

### For Converting Plain Go Code to GoFr:
1. **Identify HTTP Handlers**:
   - Look for `http.HandleFunc` or `http.NewServeMux` in the code.
   - Extract endpoints and their respective handler logic.

2. **Replace with GoFr Components**:
   - Use the `gofr.New()` method to initialize the GoFr app.
   - Convert the existing handlers into GoFr-compatible format by:
     - Changing the function signature to `func(ctx *gofr.Context) (interface{}, error)`.
     - Using `ctx.Request` for accessing request parameters and body.
     - Using `ctx.Response` for setting headers and writing the response.

3. **Add Middleware** (if needed):
   - Integrate middleware for logging, authentication, and validation as per GoFr patterns.

4. **Define Routes**:
   - Register routes using `app.GET`, `app.POST`, etc., for each endpoint.

### For Optimizing Existing GoFr Code:
1. **Refactor Handlers**:
   - Ensure each handler focuses on a single responsibility.
   - Use reusable utility functions for repetitive tasks like input validation or response formatting.

2. **Enhance Logging**:
   - Replace simple log statements with GoFr’s level-based logging.
   - Log errors and request information in a structured format for debugging.

3. **Implement Health Checks**:
   - Use GoFr’s built-in `Health` and `Readiness` checks for monitoring service availability.

4. **Optimize Metrics and Tracing**:
   - If not already present, integrate Prometheus metrics using GoFr.
   - Add tracing for user requests to track performance bottlenecks.

5. **Improve Error Handling**:
   - Use GoFr’s standardized error responses.
   - Return HTTP status codes that align with RESTful principles (e.g., `400 Bad Request`, `500 Internal Server Error`).

## Input Format
The code file should be provided in plain text format, containing either:
- Standard Go HTTP server implementation, or
- Existing GoFr-based code for optimization.

---

## Output Format
The output should include:
1. The converted or optimized code in GoFr format.
2. A summary detailing the changes made, such as:
   - List of endpoints added or refactored.
   - Middleware or enhancements implemented.
3. Any potential areas for further improvement.

## Example

### Input Code (Plain Go HTTP Example):
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
)

func HelloHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	fmt.Fprintln(w, "Hello, World!")
}

func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/hello", HelloHandler)
	http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
